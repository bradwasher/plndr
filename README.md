PLNDR provides identification and quick survey endpoints
and captures screenshots and source code of web pages and banner grabs 
of tty services.  Interfaces and ports searched for are configurable by
editing plndr.ini file.

PLNDR wraps and depends upon the following tools
 1. nmap
 2. arp-scan
 3. wkhtmltopdf

Collected data is stored in a directory that is created at run-time and named after the timestamp the script is run.
